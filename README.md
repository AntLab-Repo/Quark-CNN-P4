## About the code


### Tofino ASIC

The core is written by P4<sub>16</sub> running in programmable switches (i.e., Tofino AISC).

The Tofino-version code implements the CNN, whose model consists of three convolutional layers (c1=4, c2=4, c3=4) and two fully connected layers (l1=4, l2=4). Each convolutional layer is followed by a ReLU layer and a MaxPooling layer, while each fully connected layer is followed by a ReLU layer.

A single Tofino can support more than two pipelines. The `two_pipe.p4` file provides two main functions for the two pipelines: `pipea` is the CNN inference pipeline, and `pipeb` is the feature data pipeline. You can implement the code for feature collection in the following section:

```
Pipeline(MyIngressParser_b(),
         MyIngress_b(),
         MyIngressDeparser_b(),
         MyEgressParser_b(),
         MyEgress_b(),
         MyEgressDeparser_b()
         ) pipeb;
```

When you want to use it, please compile the `two_pipe.p4` file.

Quark is an innovative architecture designed to enable efficient data plane inference. 

Quark's primary contribution lies in addressing the challenges of resource-constrained hardware environments by optimizing inference performance, ultimately achieving the complete deployment of CNNs on PDP.

The previous work, **IN3**, is the first step of model compression in PISA, envisioning an automatic model compression for training process and discussing resource limitations of the data plane pipeline for CNN inference.
